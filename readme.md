### Requires

1. Vim >= 8.0 with `timer` and `job` .
   strongly recommend to use the newest one(Vim 8.2).

### Optional

**Thanks to [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/), ECY had packed itself into one executable file, supports Windows, Linux and Macos. So you DONOT have to install Python anymore.**

1. Python >= 3.0 with standard library.
   strongly recommend to use python3.6+
